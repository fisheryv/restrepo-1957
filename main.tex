[\emph{Editor's note:} This paper seems to have no digital record, despite
being cited many times in the game theory literature. Many years after first
learning about games of timing from Anthony Mendes, a colleague posed a version
of this problem to me, which spurred me to find the origin. I obtained a
printed copy of \emph{Contributions to the Theory of Games, Vol.  III}, 1957,
which was originally in the library of Bell Labs. It was checked out three
times. I have slightly modified the notation, which was originally typeset on a
typewriter. I also added notes (signified as this one) to clarify some claims.
I have tried to do so in a way that adds to the paper.]

\section{Introduction}

A zero-sum, two-person game can be defined by a triplet $(X, Y, \Psi)$ where
$X$ and $Y$ are two closed sets, and $\Psi$ is a real-valued, measurable
function defined on $X \times Y$; $\Psi$ is called the \emph{pay-off} or
\emph{utility function}. The elements $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$ are called
\emph{pure strategies}; the positive measures with total measure $1$ defined
over $X$ and $Y$ are called (\emph{mixed}) \emph{strategies}. The game has a
solution if there exist two strategies $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ such that for all $y
\in Y$,

\[
    \int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) \geq v,
\]

and for all $x \in X$,

\[
    \int \Psi(x, y) dG(y) \leq v.
\]

$F$ and $G$ are called \emph{optimal strategies}; $v$ is the \emph{value} of
the game.

We shall consider a class of games that can be interpreted as tactical
problems. Each game will represent a context between two players who are trying
to achieve the same objective. When one of them succeeds, he wins one unit; his
opponent loses the same amount, and the contest is over. Each player has
limited resources and can only make a fixed number of attempts to reach his
goal; these attempts must be made during the interval $0 \leq t \leq 1$, and
each attempt may fail or succeed. At $t=0$, every attempt fails; at $t=1$,
every attempt succeeds; at any other time $t$, an attempt made by Player 1 will
be successful with probability $P(t)$, and will fail with probability $1 -
P(t)$; an attempt made by Player 2 succeeds with probability $Q(t)$, fails with
probability $1- Q(t)$; the functions $P$ and $Q$ increase continuously. Each
player knows these functions and the total number of attempts that his opponent
can make; however, after the contest begins each player is unable to find out
how many unsuccessful attempts have been made by his opponent. This description
can be specialized to a combat between two airplanes: $P$ and $Q$ describe the
accuracy of firing machinery, and the initial resources correspond to the total
amount of ammunition that each plane can carry; since it is assumed that each
pilot is unable to find out how many times his opponent has fired and missed,
this problem is often called a \emph{silent duel}. In the formal description of
the game, $x$ and $y$ will be vectors that describe the times when the attempts
are made; $\Psi(x, y)$ will be the expected gain for Player 1.

A special silent duel was solved by L. S. Shapley. A class of similar problems
(called Games of Timing) has been studied by M Shiffman and S. Karlin; the
problems considered in Karlin include a larger class of utility functions, but
allow only one action by each player. It should be pointed out that the silent
duels are essentially different from the noisy duels considered by D. Blackwell
and M. A. Girshick; apparently, the recursive method they used cannot be
adapted for the solution of our problems.

\section{Description of the optimal strategies}

Each game is characterized by two numbers $m$ and $n$ that denote the total
number of attempts that each player can make. The solutions are characterized
by two sets of numbers $a_1, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, \dots, b_m$ that depend only
on $P, Q, m,$ and $n$. In every optimal strategy, the $i$-th action of Player
1 and the $j$-th action of Player 2 must be carried out during the intervals
$[a_i, a_{i+1}], [b_j, b_{j+1}]$; in every game, $a_1 = b_1,$ and $a_{n+1} =
b_{m+1} = 1$.

The optimal strategies are not necessarily unique, but each player has
precisely one in which all attempts are made independently. In this special
strategy, Player 1 will make his $i$-th attempt at time $x_i$, chosen at random
by means of a probability distribution $F_i(x_i)$; $F_n(x_n)$ may have a
discrete mass $\alpha$ at $x_n = 1$; away from $1$, each $F_i$ is absolutely
continuous and has a piecewise continuous density. The discontinuities of the
densities occur at the points $b_1, \dots, b_m$; precisely,

\[
dF_i(x_i) = \begin{cases}
h_i f^*(x_i) dx_i & \textup{ if } a_i < x_i < a_{i+1} \\
0                 & \textup{ if } x_i \not \in [a_i, a_{i+1}] \\
\end{cases}
\]

where

\[
f^*(t) = \prod_{b_j > t} \left [ 1 - Q(b_j) \right ] \frac{Q'(t)}{Q^2(t) P(t)}.
\]

The constants $h_i$ and $h_{i+1}$ are related by the equation

\[
h_i = [1 - D_i] h_{i+1},
\]

where

\[
D_i = \int_{a_i}^{a_{i+1}} P(t) dF_i(t).
\]

Player 2 has a similar strategy that can be described in an analogous way. It
is sufficient to interchange the roles of $P, Q, a_i$ and $b_j$ in the previous
description.

EXAMPLE. Symmetric Game: $P(t) = Q(t),$ and $n = m$. In this case the two
players have the same optimal strategies; $\alpha = 0$, and $a_k = b_k, k=1,
\dots, n$. Furthermore

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(a_{n-k}) &= \frac{1}{2k+3} & k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1, \\
dF_{n-k}(t) &= \frac{1}{4(k+1)} \frac{P'(t)}{P^3(t)} dt & a_{n-k} < t <
a_{n-k+1}.
\end{aligned}
\]

\section{Definitions of $X, Y, P, Q$ and $\Psi$}

$X$ and $Y$ are defined as

\[
\begin{aligned}
   X &= \{ x \in E^n \mid 0 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \dots \leq x_n \leq 1 \} \\
   Y &= \{ y \in E^m \mid 0 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq \dots \leq y_m \leq 1 \}.
\end{aligned}
\]

$E^n$ and $E^m$ denote the $n$ and $m$-dimensional Euclidean spaces.

$P$ and $Q$ will be real-valued, continuously differentiable functions
defined on the interval $[0,1]$. They must satisfy the following conditions,
stated just for $P$:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(0) &= 0 \\ P(1) &= 1 \\ P'(t) &> 0 \textup{ for } 0 < t < 1
\end{aligned}
\]

The symbols $z, r(z_k), s(z_k), \Psi(z)$ are defined only when $x \in X$ and
$y \in Y$ are two vectors such that $x_i \neq y_j$, all $i, j$. Then $z$
denotes the vector whose components are the numbers $x_1, \dots, y_m$,
re-arranged in increasing order; for $k = 1, \dots, n+m$, either $z_k = x_i$
(for some $i$), or $z_k = y_j$ (for some $j$), but not both. Thus

\[
r(z_k) = \begin{cases}
P(x_i) & \textup{ if } z_k = x_i, \\
-Q(y_j) & \textup{ if } z_k = y_j;
\end{cases}
\]

and

\[
s(z_k) = \begin{cases}
P(x_i) & \textup{ if } z_k = x_i, \\
Q(y_j) & \textup{ if } z_k = y_j;
\end{cases}
\]

are well defined functions. Finally, $\Psi(z)$ is defined recursively as
follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Psi(z_1, \dots, z_k) &= r(z_1) + [1 - s(z_1)] \Psi(z_2, \dots, z_k) \\
\Psi(z_2, \dots, z_k) &= r(z_2) + [1 - s(z_2)] \Psi(z_3, \dots, z_k) \\
& \vdots \\
\Psi(z_k) &= r(z_k).
\end{aligned}
\]

[\emph{Editor's note:} The formulas above literally encode the logical formula
``The player who acts at time $z_1$ succeeds at $z_1$ OR (That player acts but
misses at $z_1$ AND the next player to act succeeds at time $z_2$
OR($\dots$)).'' The usage of $r$ makes $\Psi$ encode the expected utility to
Player 1. If Player 2 wins, it's a negative payoff to Player 1. The $s$ is
needed to ensure failed actions represent probabilities.]

The number of components in $x$ and $y$ is not essential, and the definition
can be applied to a single vector $x \in X$, or to a single vector $y \in Y$.
In this case one may say that the other vector has no components.

The pay-off function $\Psi(x, y)$ is defined as follows: if each component
of $x$ is different from each component of $y$, then

\[
    \Psi(x, y) = \Psi(z)
\]

where $\Psi(z)$ is the number defined above. If the given condition is not
satisfied, then

\[
    \Psi(\overline{x}, \overline{y}) = \frac{1}{2}
    [\Psi(\overline{x + 0}, \overline{y - 0}) +
    \Psi(\overline{x - 0}, \overline{y + 0})
    ]
\]

[\emph{Editor's note:} Restrepo uses overlines for vectors (which I have
omitted except in the above formula). I have not seen his notation $\overline{x
\pm 0}$ before. I believe it should be interpreted as a left or right limit by
some arbitrarily small perturbation, i.e., $\Psi(\overline{x+0}) = \lim_{t \to
0}\Psi(\overline{x} + t\overline{1})$. If correct, this seems like a somewhat
complicated way to say ``break ties randomly.'']

\section{Some properties of $\Psi(x, y)$}

$\Psi(x, y)$ is continuous as long as the relative order of the components of
$x$ and $y$ does not change. Furthermore, $\Psi(x, y)$ is skew-symmetric in the
following sense: if the roles of $X$ and $Y$ are interchanged, $\Psi(y, x) =
-\Psi(x, y)$. Other simple properties of $\Psi$ are given in the next three
lemmas.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:psi-recursive}

If $z = (z_1, \dots, z_t, z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k)$, then

\[
\Psi(z) = \Psi(z_1, \dots, z_t) +
\prod_{i=1}^t [1-s(z_i)] \Psi(z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k)
\]

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

If $t = 1$, the formula reduces to the definition of $\Psi(z)$. For $t > 1$,
the formula is proved by induction. The details are omitted.

[\emph{Editor's note:} While the above follows from induction and some algebra,
it is perhaps easier to prove it in words: the payoff of the whole game is the
payoff of the first $t$ steps, provided some action taken in those steps
succeeds, OR, the payoff in the last $k - t$ steps, provided \emph{no} action
taken in the first $t$ steps succeeds.]

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:psi-remove-one}

If $z = (z_1, \dots, z_{t-1}, z_t, z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k)$, then

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Psi(z) &= \Psi(z_1, \dots, z_{t-1}, z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k)  \\
&+ \prod_{i=1}^{t-1} [1 - s(z_i)] [r(z_t) - s(z_t) \Psi(z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k)]
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

By Lemma~\ref{lemma:psi-recursive},

\[
\Psi(z) = \Psi(z_1, \dots, z_{t-1}) +
\prod_{i=1}^{t-1} [1-s(z_i)] \Psi(z_t, \dots, z_k),
\]

and

\[
\Psi(z_t, \dots, z_k) =
r(z_t) + [1-s(z_t)] \Psi(z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k).
\]

Therefore,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Psi(z) &= \Psi(z_1, \dots, z_{t-1}) +
\prod_{i=1}^{t-1} [1 - s(z_i)] \Psi(z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k) \\
&+ \prod_{i=1}^{t-1} [1 - s(z_i)] [r(z_t) - s(z_t) \Psi(z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k)]
\end{aligned}
\]

Lemma~\ref{lemma:psi-recursive} shows that the first two terms can be replaced
by \\ $\Psi(z_1, \dots, z_{t-1}, z_{t+1}, \dots, z_k)$.

\end{proof}


\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:psi-monotone-increasing}

For any fixed $y$, $\Psi(x, y)$ is a monotone increasing function of each
component $x_i$ of $x$ as long as $x_i$ ranges over an open interval that does
not contain any components of $y$. Similarly, for any fixed $x$, $\Psi(x, y)$
is a monotone decreasing function of each component $y_j$ of $y$ as long as
$y_j$ ranges over an open interval that does not contain any components of $x$.

\end{lemma}

[\emph{Editor's note:} Restated, fixing Player 2's strategy, in considering the
action time for action $i$, it is better for Player 1 to wait as long as
possible before acting, as their probability of success increases over time.
This is not true if Player 1 waits so long that Player 2 acts, because
Player 2 may succeed. But so long as that doesn't happen, Player 1's expected
utility increases.]

\begin{proof}

Since $\Psi(x, y)$ is skew-symmetric in $x$ and $y$, it is sufficient to prove
only the first half of the lemma. The result is established by means of
Lemma~\ref{lemma:psi-remove-one}. Indeed, any component of $x_i$ appears only
in the term

\[
    \prod_{k=1}^{i-1} [1 - P(x_k)] \prod_{y_j < x_i} [1 - Q(y_j)] [P(x_i) -
P(x_i) \Psi(z^*)],
\]

where $z^*$ is the vector constructed from those components of $x$ and $y$ that
are larger than $x_i$. It is clear that the first two factors are positive;
furthermore $-1 \leq \Psi(z) \leq 1$, for all $z$. Thus the coefficient of
$P(x_i)$ is positive, and $\Psi(x, y)$ is a monotone increasing function of
$x_i$.

\end{proof}

\section{Strategies of the class $O$}

\begin{definition} \label{defn:class-o}

A strategy $F(x)$ belongs to the class $O$ if it satisfies the following
conditions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item $F$ is separate, i.e.

\[
    F(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n F_i(x_i).
\]

\item Each $F_i$ is a positive measure with total mass $1$; furthermore, the
support of each $F_i$ (i.e., the complement of the largest open set on which
$F_i$ vanishes) is a non-degenerate interval $[a_i, a_{i+1}]$; also, $a_1 > 0$,
and $a_{n+1} = 1$.

\item The first $n-1$ measures are continuous; the last measure $F_n$ may have
only one discontinuity with mass $\alpha$ at $x_n = 1$.

\end{enumerate}

Equivalent conditions are used when dealing with measures $G(y)$ defined over
$Y$.

\end{definition}

\begin{notation}

In the following sections, $D_i$ and $R(y)$ will always denote the expected
values of $P$ and $\Psi$. That is,

\[
\begin{aligned}
D_i &= \int_{a_i}^{a_{i+1}} P(t) dF_i(t) \\
R(y) &= \int \Psi(x,y) dF(x).
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{notation}

The vector $D^k$ and the function $\phi(D^k)$ are defined as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
D^k &= (D_{k+1}, D_{k+2}, \dots, D_n) \\
\phi(D^{k-1}) &= D_k + [1 - D_k] \phi(D^k) \\
& \dots \\
\phi(D^{n}) &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\]

Using the last definition, it is easy to see that

\[
\int \Psi(x_{k+1}, \dots, x_n) dF_{k+1}(x_{k+1}) \dots dF_n(x_n)
= \phi(D^k).
\]

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:marginal-r-formula}

Let $F(x)$ be in the class $O$, and let $y \in Y$ be a vector whose last
component $y_m$ is contained in the open interval $(a_k, a_{k+1})$. Then

\[
\begin{aligned}
& R(y_1, \dots, y_{m-1}, y_m) - R(y_1, \dots, y_{m-1}) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} [1 - D_i] \prod_{j=1}^{m-1} [1 - Q(y_j)][-Q(y_m)] \cdot \\
&\cdot \left \{
  2 \int_{y_m}^{a_{k+1}} P(x_k) dF_k(x_k) + [1 - D_k][1 + \phi(D^k)]
\right \}.
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Let $y$ be the given vector and let $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ be any vector
contained in the support of $F(x)$. Lemma~\ref{lemma:psi-remove-one} can be
used to separate all the terms of $\Psi(x, y)$ that depend on $y_m$; thus, if
$a_k \leq x_k < y_m$,

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\Psi(x, (y_1, \dots, y_{m-1}, y_m)) - \Psi(x, (y_1, \dots, y_{m-1})) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^k [1 - P(x_i)] \prod_{j=1}^{m-1} [1 - Q(y_j)][-Q(y_m)]
[1 + \Psi(x_{k+1}, \dots, x_n)].
\end{aligned}
\]

But if $y_m < x_k \leq a_{k+1}$, [\emph{Editor's note:} the only difference is
the very last term includes $x_k$.]

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\Psi(x, (y_1, \dots, y_{m-1}, y_m)) - \Psi(x, (y_1, \dots, y_{m-1})) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^k [1 - P(x_i)] \prod_{j=1}^{m-1} [1 - Q(y_j)][-Q(y_m)]
[1 + \Psi(x_k, x_{k+1}, \dots, x_n)].
\end{aligned}
\]

The vectors $x$ with $x_k = y_m$ have $F$-measure zero. Therefore,

[\emph{Editor's note:} For brevity, define:

\[
A = \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} (1 - D_i) \prod_{j=1}^{m-1} (1 - Q(y_j))(-Q(y_m)).
\]

Then:]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& R(y_1, \dots, y_{m-1}, y_m) - R(y_1, \dots, y_{m-1}) \\
&= \int [\Psi(x, (y_1, \dots, y_{m-1}, y_m)) - \Psi(x, (y_1, \dots, y_{m-1}))] dF(x) \\
&= A \int_{a_k}^{y_m} [1 - P(x_k)][1 + \phi(D^k)] dF_k(x_k)
+ A \int_{y_m}^{a_{k+1}} [1 + P(x_k) + (1 - P(x_k)) \phi(D^k)] dF_k(x_k) \\
&= 2A \int_{y_m}^{a_{k+1}} \left [
    P(x_k) dF_k(x_k) + [1 - D_k][1 + \phi(D^k)]
\right ].
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:r-is-continuous}

If $F$ belongs to the class $O$, $R(y)$ is a continuous function of $y$, except
when $y_m = 1$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

The result follows from the fact that $\Psi(x, y)$ has only simple
discontinuities located on the diagonals $x_i = y_j$; $F$ is continuous except
at $x_n = 1$. An alternate proof may be based on the fact that the right-hand
side of the last equation varies continuously as $y_m$ increases from $a_k -
\varepsilon$ to $a_k + \varepsilon$.

\end{proof}

\section{Corresponding strategies}

\begin{definition} \label{defn:corresponding-strategies}

Let $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ be two measures contained in the class $O$, and let $S_f$
and $S_G$ denote the supports of their measures. $F$ and $G$ form a pair of
corresponding strategies if

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) = v, \qquad \textup{ for all } y \in S_G, y_m \neq 1
\]

and

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dG(x) = v, \qquad \textup{ for all } x \in S_F, x_n \neq 1
\]

\end{definition}

\begin{notation}

Since $F$ and $G$ belong to the class $O$,

\[
F(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n F_i(x_i), \qquad G(y) = \prod_{j=1}^m G_j(y_j),
\]

and the supports of $F_i$ and $G_j$ are intervals $[a_i, a_{i+1}], [b_j,
b_{j+1}]$. The numbers $b_1, \dots, b_m$ can be rearranged into subsets, one
subset for each interval $[a_i, a_{i+1}]$; the resulting array can be written
in the form

\[
\begin{aligned}
a_1 &\leq b_{1,1} < b_{1, 2} < \dots < b_{1, r_1} < a_2 \\
a_2 &\leq b_{2,1} < b_{2, 2} < \dots < b_{2, r_2} < a_3 \\
\vdots & \\
a_n &\leq b_{n,1} < b_{n, 2} < \dots < b_{n, r_n} < a_{n+1} = 1.
\end{aligned}
\]

It is possible that there are no $b$'s between two adjacent $a$'s.

Every interval bounded by two adjacent $b$'s must contain precisely one
component of each vector $y \in S_G$. It is possible to identify the component
by means of the interval over which it ranges; for instance, $y_{i,j}$ will
denote the component of $y$ that is contained in the interval $[b_{i,j}, b_{i,
j+1}]$. When two adjacent $b$'s are separated by one of the $a$'s, say $a_i$,
it is convenient to write

\[
    a_i = b_{i, 0}.
\]

In this case, $y_{i-1, r_{i-1}}$ and $y_{i, 0}$ denote the same component of
$y$.

\end{notation}

In the following lemma, $\alpha$ denotes the discrete mass that $F_n(x_n)$ may
have at $x_n = 1$.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:coefficient-equations}

Let $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ be two strategies contained in the class $O$. Then

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) = v, \qquad \textup{ for all } y \in S_G, y_m \neq 1
\]

if and only if the following conditions hold simultaneously:

\begin{enumerate}

\item In the open interval $(b_{i, j}, b_{i, j+1})$, the measure $F_i(x_i)$ is
absolutely continuous and

\[
dF_i(x_i) = h_{i, j} \frac{Q'(x_i)}{Q^2(x_i) P(x_i)} dx_i.
\]

\item The coefficients $h_{i, j}$ satisfy the equations

\[
\begin{aligned}
1 + 2\alpha &= D_n + 2h_{n, r_n} \\
h_{i, j-1} &= [1 - Q(b_{i, j})] h_{i, j}, \qquad j = 1, \dots, r_i; i = 1,
\dots, n \\
h_{i, r_i} &= [1 - D_i] h_{i+1, 0}, \qquad i = 1, \dots, n.
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{enumerate}

The first condition requires that $a_1 \leq b_1$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Let $y = (y_{1, 1}, \dots, y_{n, r_n})$ be any vector in $S_G$, and define

\[
K_{i,j} = \prod_{s=1}^{i-1} [1 - D_s]
          \prod_{y_{s, t} < y_{i, j}} [1 - Q(y_{s, t})],
\]

where the second product is taken over all the components of $y$ that precede
$y_{i, j}$. By Lemma~\ref{lemma:marginal-r-formula},

\begin{align}
R(y) &= R(y_{1, 1}, \dots, y_{n, r_n - 1}) \label{eqn:six-one} \\
 &- K_{n, r_n} Q(y_{n, r_n})
\left [ 2 \int_{y_{n, r_n}}^1 P(x_n) dF_n(x_n) + (1 - D_n) \right ]. \notag
\end{align}

Therefore, $R(y)$ is independent of $y_{n, r_n}$ if and only if

\begin{align}
Q(y_{n, r_n})
\left [ 2 \int_{y_{n, r_n}}^1 P(x_n) dF_n(x_n) + (1 - D_n) \right ] &= 2h_{n,
r_n}, \label{eqn:six-one-a} \\
& \textup{ for all } b_{n, r_n} < y_{n, r_n} < 1, \notag
\end{align}

for some constant $h_{n, r_n}$; furthermore, if~\eqref{eqn:six-one-a} holds,
equation~\eqref{eqn:six-one} becomes

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:six-one-b}
R(y) = R(y_{1, 1}, \dots, y_{n, r_n-1}) - 2K_{n, r_n} h_{n, r_n}.
\end{equation}

The dependence of $R(y)$ on the component $y_{i,j}$ is studied by successive
applications of Lemma~\ref{lemma:marginal-r-formula}; two cases must be
considered.

\textbf{Case 1}. $j \neq r_i$. Let us assume that if $R(y)$ is independent of
all the components of $y$ that lie beyond $y_{i, j}$, then

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:six-second-b}
R(y) = R(y_{1, 1}, \dots, y_{i, j}) - 2K_{i, j+1} \gamma_{i, j+1}
\end{equation}

for some constant $\gamma_{i, j+1}$. Then, by definition,

\[
K_{i, j+1} = [1 - Q(y_{i,j})] K_{i,j}.
\]

Furthermore, Lemma~\ref{lemma:marginal-r-formula} can be applied to $R(y_{1,
1}, \dots, y_{i, j})$. Then

\[
\begin{aligned}
R(y) &= R(y_{1, 1}, \dots, y_{i, j-1}) - 2K_{i, j} \gamma_{i, j+1} \\
&- K_{i, j} Q(y_{i, k}) \left [
2 \int_{y_{i, j}}^{a_{i+1}} P(x_i) dF_i(x_i) + (1-D_i)(1 + \phi(D^i)) - 2
\gamma_{i, j+1}
\right ].
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, $R(y)$ is also independent of $y_{i, j}$ if and only if

\begin{align}
Q(y_{i, j}) &
\left [
2 \int_{y_{i, j}}^{a_{i+1}} P(x_i) dF_i(x_i) + (1 - D_i) (1 + \phi(D^i)) -
2\gamma_{i, j+1}
\right ] \label{eqn:six-second-a} \\
&= 2h_{i, j}, \textup{ for all } b_{i, j} < y_{i, j} < b_{i, j+1}, \notag
\end{align}

for some constant $h_{i, j}$; furthermore, if \eqref{eqn:six-second-b} is valid
for the indices $i, j+1$, and \eqref{eqn:six-second-a} is valid for the indices
$i, j$, then

\[
R(y) = R(y_{1, 1}, \dots, y_{i, j-1}) - 2K_{i, j} \gamma_{i, j}
\]

where

\begin{equation}
\gamma_{i, j} = h_{i,j} + \gamma_{i, j+1}. \label{eqn:six-two}
\end{equation}

This result justifies the assumption~\eqref{eqn:six-second-b}, provided that
$i$ is fixed.

\textbf{Case 2}. $j = r_i$. In the present notation $y_{i, r_i}$ and $y_{i+1,
0}$ denote the same component of $y$; as a matter of fact, if two adjacent
$b$'s are separated by $a_{i+1}, \dots, a_{i + k'}$, the component of $y$ that
follows $y_{i, r_i}$ is $y_{i+k, 1}$. The process outlined in Case 1 shows that
if $R(y)$ is independent of the components of $y$ that lie beyond $y_{i,
r_i}$, then

\[
R(y) = R(y_{1, 1}, \dots, y_{i, r_i}) - 2K_{i+k, 1} \gamma_{i+k, 1}.
\]

The arguments that were used in the previous case can be applied again, but in
this case

\[
K_{i+k, 1} = \prod_{t=i}^{i+k-1} (1 - D_t) (1 - Q(y_{i, r_i})) K_{i, r_i}
\]

and $R(y)$ is independent of $y_{i, r_i}$, if and only if [for all $y_{i, r_i}$
between $b_{i, r_i}$ and $a_{i+1}$, and letting $\varphi_i = (1-D_i)(1 +
\phi(D^i))$,]

\begin{equation}
 2h_{i,r_i} = Q(y_{i,r_i}) \left [ 2 \int_{y_{i,r_i}}^{a_{i+1}} P(x_i) dF_i(x_i)
+ \varphi_i - 2 \prod_{t=i}^{i+k-1} (1-D_t) \gamma_{i+k, 1} \right ] \label{eqn:six-third-a}
\end{equation}

for some constant $h_{i,r_i}$; when equation~\ref{eqn:six-third-a} holds, $R(y)$
can be written in the form

\begin{equation}
R(y) = R(y_{1,1}, \dots, y_{i, r_i - 1}) - 2K_{i, r_i} \gamma_{i, r_i}
\label{eqn:six-third-b}
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
\gamma_{i, r_i} = h_{i, r_i} + \prod{t=i}^{i+k-1} (1-D_t) \gamma_{i+k, 1}.
\label{eqn:six-three}
\end{equation}

These considerations show that $R(y)$ is independent of $y$ if and only if
condition~\ref{eqn:six-third-a} holds for every pair of indices $i, j$.  In the
special case $i=1, j=r_{n'}$, the given condition can also be written in the
form

\[
Q(y_{n,r_n}) \left [ 2 \int_{y_{n,r_n}}^{1} P(x_n) dF_n^*(x_n)
+ 2 \alpha + 1 - 2 D_n \right ] = 2h_{n,r_n},
\]

where $F_n^*$ is the continuous part of $F_n$; every one of these conditions is
of the form

\[
2 \int_{t}^{a_{i+1}} P(x) dF_i(x) + C = \frac{2h_{i, j}}{Q(t)},
\qquad b_{i,j} < t < b_{i, j+1},
\]

with $F_i$ continuous and $C$ constant. An integration by parts shows that
$F_i$ must be absolutely continuous in the given interval, and then, by
differentiation,

\begin{equation}
dF_i(t) = h_{i,j} \frac{Q'(t)}{Q^2(t) P(t)} dt, \qquad b_{i,j} < t < b_{i, j+1}.
\label{eqn:six-third-c}
\end{equation}

The integral that appears in each one of those conditions
\label{eqn:six-third-a} can be evaluated explicitly by means of
\label{eqn:six-third-c}; it is then seen that \label{eqn:six-third-a} holds if
and only if \label{eqn:six-third-c} holds and also

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2h_{n, r_n} &= 2\alpha + 1 - D_n \\
\frac{2h_{i,j}}{Q(b_{i, j+1})} &= 2 \int_{b_{i, j+1}}^{a_{i+1}} P(x_i) dF_i(x_i) \\
&+ (1-D_i)(1 + \phi(D^i)) - 2 \gamma_{i, j+1}, \qquad j \neq r_i  \\
\frac{2h_{i,r_i}}{Q(a_{i+1})} &=
(1-D_i)(1 + \phi(D^i)) - 2 \prod_{t=i}^{i+k-1} (1-d_t) \gamma_{i+k, 1}, \qquad j
= r_i.
\end{split}
\label{eqn:six-d}
\end{equation}

In order to complete the proof of the lemma it is sufficient to replace this
system of equations by the equivalent system that is obtained by subtracting
from each equation the preceding one; for instance, if the equation that
contains $h_{i, j+1}$ is subtracted from the equation that contains $h_{i,j}$,
then

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{2h_{i,j}}{Q(b_{i, j+1})}
- \frac{2h_{i,j+1}}{Q(b_{i, j+2})}
&= \\
&= 2 \int_{b_{i, j+1}}^{b_{i, j+2}} P(x_i)dF_i(x_i) + 2\gamma_{i, j+2} -
2\gamma_{i, j+1} \\
&= 2h_{i, j+1} \left [
    \frac{1}{Q(b_{i, j+1})} - \frac{1}{Q(b_{i, j+2})}
\right ] - 2h_{i, j+1}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Simplifying,

\[
h_{i,j} = [1 - Q(b_{i, j+1})] h_{i, j+1}.
\]

Similarly, the equations that contain $h_{i, r_i}$ and $h_{i+1, 0}$ show that

\[
h_{i, r_i} = (1 - D_i) h_{i+1, 0}.
\]

It may happen that one of the original $a_i$'s coincides with one of the
original $b_j$'s, say $a_{i+1} = b_{i+1, 1}$. In this case, the system
\ref{eqn:six-d} does not contain an equation with $h_{i+1, 0}$ and the last
derivation is not valid. However, subtracting in this case the equation with
$h_{i, r_i}$ from the equation with $h_{i+1, 1}$, one can see that

\[
h_{i, r_i} = (1 - D_i)[1 - Q(a_{i+1})] h_{i+1, 1}.
\]

In this case i tis convenient to introduce the unnecessary parameter $h_{i+1,
0}$ defined by

\[
h_{i+1, 0} = [1 - Q(a_{i+1})]h_{i+1, 1} = [1-Q(b_{i+1, 1})]h_{i+1, 1},
\]

if $a_{i+1} = b_{i+1, 1}$. With this definition, $h_{i, r_i}$, $h_{i+1, 0}$,
and $h_{i+1, 1}$ are always related by the equations stated in the lemma.

\end{proof}


\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:value-of-the-game}

Let $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ be contained in the class $O$. If

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) = v_1 \qquad \textup{for all } y \in S_G, y_m \neq 1,
\]

then

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) \geq v_1 \qquad \textup{for all } y \in Y.
\]

If

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dG(y) = v_2 \qquad \textup{for all } x \in S_F, x_n \neq 1,
\]

then

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dG(x) \geq v_2 \qquad \textup{for all } x \in X.
\]

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\textbf{First inequality.} The definition of $\Psi(x, y)$ implies that

\[
\Psi(x, y) \geq \Psi(x, \overline{y-0}), \qquad \textup{for all } x, y.
\]

Therefore, it is sufficient to consider only those vectors $y$ with $y_m \neq
1$. The inequality is proved by induction, and we may assume that it has been
established for all the vectors $y$ whose last $m-q$ components coincide with
the last $m-q$ components of some vector in the support of $G(y)$.

Let $y = (y_1, \dots, y_{q+1}, y^*_{q+2}, \dots, y^*_m)$ be a vector whose last
$m - (q+1)$ components coincide with the last $m - (q+1)$ components of some
vector in the support of $G$. The assumptions of this lemma imply that $R(y)$
must satisfy all the equations derived in the proof of
Lemma~\ref{lemma:coefficient-equations}. In particular, $R(y)$ must be
independent of all the starred components, and (by \ref{eqn:six-one-b}),

\[
R(y) = R(y_1, \dots, y_q, y_{q+1})
 - 2 \prod_{s=1}^{i-1}(1-D_s)
\prod_{t=1}^{q+1} [1 - Q(y_t)] \gamma_{i, j+1},
\]

where $b_{i, j+1} \leq y^*_{q+2} \leq b_{i, j+2}$. Consider four cases.

\textbf{Case 1:} $y_{q+1} > b_{i, j+1}$. In this case we must have $b_{i, j+1}
< y_{q+1} \leq b_{i, j+2}$. Then, by Lemma~\ref{lemma:marginal-r-formula},

\begin{align*}
R(y)
&= R(y_1, \dots, y_q) - 2 \prod_{s=1}^{i-1}(1-D_s)
\prod_{t=1}^{q+1} [1 - Q(y_t)] \gamma_{i, j+1} \\
&- \prod_{s=1}^{i-1}(1-D_s) \prod_{t=1}^{q} [1 - Q(y_t)] \cdot  \\
& \cdot Q(y_{q+1}) \left [
    2 \int_{y_{q+1}}^{a_{i+1}} P(t) dF_i(t) + (1-D_i)(1+\phi(D^i))
\right ].
\end{align*}

Furthermore, by condition~\ref{eqn:six-one-a} from
Lemma~\ref{lemma:coefficient-equations}, if $b_{i, j+1} < y < b_{i, j+2}$,

\[
2h_{i, j+1} = Q(y) \left [
  2 \int_{y}^{a_{i+1}} P(t) dF_i(t) + (1-D_i)(1+\phi(D^i)) - 2 \gamma_{i, j+2}
\right ].
\]

Hence,

\begin{align*}
R(y)
&= R(y_1, \dots, y_q) - 2 \prod_{s=1}^{i-1}(1-D_s)
\prod_{t=1}^{q+1} [1 - Q(y_t)] \gamma_{i, j+1} \\
&- \prod_{s=1}^{i-1}(1-D_s) \prod_{t=1}^{q} [1 - Q(y_t)] \cdot  \\
& \cdot \left [
2h_{i, j+1} + 2(\gamma_{i, j+2} - \gamma_{i, j+1})Q(y_{q+1})
\right ].
\end{align*}

By equation~\ref{eqn:six-two}, $\gamma_{i, j+1} - \gamma_{i, j+1} = -h_{i,
j+1}$; clearly, $R(y)$ is a monotone increasing function of $y_{q+1}$. If the
components $y_p, y_{p+1}, \dots, y_q$ also lie in the interval $[b_{i, j+1},
b_{i, j+2}]$, the same argument will show that $R(y)$ is a monotone increasing
function of these components, and $R(y)$ achieves a smaller value if all of
these components are replaced by $b_{i, j+1}$; we can write $y_{q+1}^* = b_{i,
j+1} \in [b_{i, j}, b_{i, j+1}]$. Then $y_{q+1}^*$ coincides with the
$(q+1)$-th component of some vector in the support of $G(y)$ and

\[
\begin{aligned}
R(y) \geq R(&y_1, \dots, y_{p-1}, b_{i, j+1}, \dots, b_{i, j+1}, \\
&y^*_{q+1}, y^*_{q+2}, \dots, y^*_{m}) \geq v.
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{Case 2:} $b_{i, j} \leq y_{q+1} \leq b_{i, j+1}$. In this case we
simply choose $y^*_{q+1} = y_{q+1}$.

\textbf{Case 3:} $a_1 \leq y_{q+1} < b_{i,j}$. For definiteness, assume that
$b_{k, l} \leq y_{q+1} < b_{k, l+1}$. Applying
Lemma~\ref{lemma:marginal-r-formula} to $R(y)$ and simplifying the result by
means of the appropriate condition~\ref{eqn:six-one-a} from
Lemma~\ref{lemma:coefficient-equations},

\[
\begin{aligned}
R(y) &= R(y_1, \dots, y_q) - \prod_{s=1}^{i-1} (1-D_s) \prod_{t=1}^q (1-Q(y_t))
\gamma_{i, j+1} \\
&- \prod_{s=1}^{k-1} (1-D_s) \prod_{t=1}^q (1-Q(y_t)) \\
& \cdot \left [ 2h_{k,l} + 2Q(y_{q+1}) \left ( \gamma_{k, l+1} -
\prod_{\sigma=k}^{i-1} (1-D_{\sigma}) \gamma_{i, j+1} \right ) \right ].
\end{aligned}
\]

The definition of the constant $\gamma_{k, l+1}$ (equations~\ref{eqn:six-two}
and~\ref{eqn:six-three}) shows that $R(y)$ is a monotone dereasing function of
$y_{q+1}$. In this case we may take $y^*_{q+1} = b_{i, j} \in [b_{i,j}, b_{i,
j+1}]$.

\textbf{Case 4:} $y_{q+1} < a_1$. By Lemma~\ref{lemma:psi-monotone-increasing},
if $x \in S_F$, $\Psi(x, y)$ is a monotone decreasing function of $y_{q+1}$.
Then $R(y)$ has the same property, and

\[
R(y) \geq R(y_1, \dots, y_q, a_1, y^*_{q+2}, \dots, y^*_m).
\]

The problem is now reduced to Case 3.

\textbf{Second inequality.} It is sufficient to interchange the roles of $X$
and $Y$ and to recall that $\Psi(y, x) = -\Psi(x, y)$. Then, by assumption

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dG(y) = v \qquad \textup{for all } x \in S_F, x_n \neq 1.
\]

Then, by the first inequality (applied to $\Psi(y, x)$)

\[
\int \Psi(y, x) dG(y) \geq -v.
\]

\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}

If $y$ is not contained in the support of $G(y)$, then

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) \geq v.
\]

\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}

This result follows from the strict monotonicity of the functions that appear
in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:value-of-the-game}.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:optimality-of-corresponding-strategies}

Let $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ be two corresponding strategies such that at least one of
them is continuous at $1$. Then $v_1 = v_2$ and $F$ and $G$ are optimal.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

For definiteness, we may assume that $G$ is continuous. By definition of $v_1$,

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) = v_1 \qquad \textup{for all } y \in S_G, y_m \neq 1.
\]

Since the vectors with $y_m = 1$ have $G$-measure zero,

\begin{equation}
\iint \Psi(x, y) dF(x) dG(y) = \int v_1 dG(y) = v_1.  \label{eqn:optimality-4}
\end{equation}

Similarly, by definition of $v_2$,

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dG(y) = v_2 \qquad \textup{for all } x \in S_F, x_n \neq 1.
\]

Since $G$ is continuous, the integral is continuous and the equation is valid
for all $x \in S_F$. Therefore,

\begin{equation}
\iint \Psi(x, y) dF(x) dG(y) = \int v_2 dF(x) = v_2.  \label{eqn:optimality-5}
\end{equation}

Equations~\ref{eqn:optimality-4} and~\ref{eqn:optimality-5} imply that $v_1 =
v_2$; this number is denoted by $v$. Lemma~\ref{lemma:value-of-the-game}
asserts that $v$ is the value of the game, and that $F$ and $G$ are optimal
strategies.

\end{proof}

\begin{remark}

It is well known that if $F$ and $G$ are optimal, then

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) = v \qquad \textup{ for all } y \in S_G,
\]

provided that $y$ is a point of continuity of the integral; a similar result is
valid when $F$ and $G$ are interchanged. In particular, any pair of optimal
strategies that belong to the class $O$ must be a pair of corresponding
strategies, and it is easy to show that one of them must be continuous at
$t=1$. This remark may be taken as the converse of
Lemma~\ref{lemma:optimality-of-corresponding-strategies}.

\end{remark}

\subsection{Characterization of corresponding strategies}

Let $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ be two strategies contained in the class $O$, and let
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ denote the discrete masses that $F_n$ and $G_m$ may have
at $x_n = 1, y_m=1$. Let

\[
\begin{aligned}
D_i = \int_{a_i}^{a_{i+1}} P(t) dF_i(t) \\
E_j = \int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} Q(t) dG_j(t),
\end{aligned}
\]

and let $f^*(x)$ and $g^*(y)$ be two discontinuous functions defined by

\begin{align}
f^*(x) &= \prod_{b_j > x} (1-Q(b_j)) \frac{Q'(x)}{Q^2(x) P(x)}
\label{eqn:characterization-6} \\
g^*(y) &= \prod_{a_i > y} (1-P(a_i)) \frac{P'(x)}{P^2(x) Q(x)} \label{eqn:characterization-7}
\end{align}

The results of Lemma~\ref{lemma:coefficient-equations} can be stated as
follows: $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ form a pair of corresponding strategies if and only
if the following conditions hold:

\begin{align}
dF_i(x_i) &= h_i f^*(x_i) dx_i, \qquad a_i < x_i < a_{i+1} \qquad i=1, \dots, n \label{eqn:characterization-8} \\
dG_j(y_j) &= k_j g^*(y_j) dy_j, \qquad b_j < y_j < b_{j+1} \qquad j=1, \dots, m \label{eqn:characterization-9} \\
1 + 2 \alpha &= D_n + 2h_n \label{eqn:characterization-10} \\
1 + 2 \beta &= E_n + 2k_n \label{eqn:characterization-11} \\
h_i &= (1-D_i) h_{i+1} \label{eqn:characterization-12} \\
k_j &= (1-E_j) k_{j+1} \label{eqn:characterization-13} \\
a_1 &= b_1
\end{align}

If these equations are used to characterize the optimal strategies, it is
necessary to include the continuity hypothesis ($\alpha \beta = 0$) of
Lemma~\ref{lemma:optimality-of-corresponding-strategies} and the normalizing
equations

\[
\int dF_i = \int dG_j = 1, \qquad i = 1, \dots, n \qquad j = 1, \dots, m.
\]

\section{Existence of a solution}

We have shown that in order to find two optimal strategies it is sufficient to
find a set of numbers $a_1, \dots, b_m, h_1, \dots, k_m$, $\alpha$, and
$\beta$ that satisfy the previous set of equations. In
equations~\ref{eqn:characterization-10}, \ref{eqn:characterization-11},
\ref{eqn:characterization-12}, and~\ref{eqn:characterization-13} it is
convenient to write $D_i$ and $E_j$ in terms of $f^*$ and $g^*$, and to
eliminate $h_n, k_m, h_i, k_j$ by means of the normalizing equations. In this
form, the complete system is as follows:

\textbf{Normalizing Equations}

\begin{align}
h_n \int_{a_n}^1 f^*(t) dt + \alpha &= 1 \label{eqn:existence-14} \\
k_m \int_{b_n}^1 g^*(t) dt + \beta &= 1 \label{eqn:existence-15} \\
h_i \int_{a_i}^{a_{i+1}} f^*(t) dt &= 1, \qquad i=1, \dots, n-1 \label{eqn:existence-16} \\
k_j \int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} g^*(t) dt &= 1, \qquad j=1, \dots, m-1 \label{eqn:existence-17}
\end{align}

\textbf{Equations from Lemma~\ref{lemma:coefficient-equations} and
Lemma~\ref{lemma:optimality-of-corresponding-strategies}}

\begin{align}
\int_{a_n}^1 \left [ (1+\alpha) - (1-\alpha)P(t) \right ] f^*(t) dt &= 2(1-\alpha) \label{eqn:existence-18} \\
\int_{b_m}^1 \left [ (1+\beta) - (1-\beta)Q(t) \right ] g^*(t) dt &= 2(1-\beta) \label{eqn:existence-19} \\
\int_{a_{i}}^{a_{i+1}} (1-P(t))f^*(t) dt &= \frac{1}{h_{i+1}} \qquad i = 1,
\dots, n-1 \label{eqn:existence-20} \\
\int_{b_{j}}^{b_{j+1}} (1-Q(t))g^*(t) dt &= \frac{1}{k_{j+1}} \qquad j=1,
\dots, m-1 \label{eqn:existence-21} \\
a_1 = b_1 \label{eqn:existence-22} \\
\alpha \beta = 0. \label{eqn:existence-23}
\end{align}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:infinite-limit}

Let $a$ be any number in the interval $(0, 1]$, and let $b_1, \dots, b_m$ be
any set of parameters, subject to the restriction $0 < b_1 < \cdots < b_m < 1$;
let $f^*$ be defined by equation~\ref{eqn:characterization-6}. Then

\[
\lim_{x \to 0} \int_{x}^a (1-P(t)) f^*(t) dt = \pm \infty.
\]

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Let

\[
M = \prod_{j=1}^m (1 - Q(b_j)),
\]

and choose $c$ such that for $t \leq c$, $1 - P(t) \geq P(t)$. Then, for $x
\leq c$,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{x}^a (1 - P(t)) f^*(t) dt &\geq \int_{x}^c M\frac{Q'(t)}{Q^2(t)} dt
+ \int_{c}^a (1-P(t)) f^*(t) dt \\
&= M \left [ \frac{1}{Q(x)} - \frac{1}{Q(c)} \right ]
+ \int_{c}^a (1-P(t)) f^*(t) dt.
\end{aligned}
\]

The first term tends to $+ \infty$; the second one is finite.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:unique-inc-dec}

Let $\alpha$ be any number in the interval $[0,1)$, and let $b_1, \dots, b_m$
be any set of parameters, subject to the restriction $0 < b_1 < \cdots < b_m <
1$. Under these assumptions, equations~\ref{eqn:existence-14},
\ref{eqn:existence-16}, \ref{eqn:existence-18}, and~\ref{eqn:existence-20} have
a unique solution $a_1, \dots, a_n, h_1, \dots, h_n$. If the $b$'s are fixed,
$a_n$ is a monotone increasing function of $\alpha$, and $a_n \to 1$ as $\alpha
\to 1$. If $\alpha$ is fixed, $a_n$ is a decreasing function of $b_m$, and $a_n
\to 0$ as $b_m \to 1$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Lemma~\ref{lemma:infinite-limit} shows that equation~\ref{eqn:existence-18} has
a solution $a_n \in (0, 1]$; since the integrand is positive, the solution is
unique, and it is clearly a continuous, monotone increasing function of
$\alpha$; setting $\alpha = 1$, one obtains $a_n = 1$; but if $\alpha < 1$,
$a_n$ must be in $(0, 1)$, and $h_n$ can be computed by means of
equation~\ref{eqn:existence-14}. When $a_n$ and $h_n$ are known, $a_{n-1}$ can
be obtained from equation~\ref{eqn:existence-20}, and $h_{n-1}$ from
equation~\ref{eqn:existence-16}. The process can be continued until all the
$a$'s and the $h$
s are found. Finally, it is necessary to consider $a_n$ as a function of $b_m$.
Let $\alpha$ and $d$ be fixed, and consider

\[
\int_{d}^{b_m} [(1 + \alpha) - (1 - \alpha) P(t)] f^*(t) dt \\
+ \int_{b_m}^{1} [(1 + \alpha) - (1 - \alpha) P(t)] f^*(t) dt.
\]

In the first term, the integrand contains the factor $(1 - Q(b_m))$ and tends
to zero uniformly as $b_m \to 1$; in the second term the integrand is bounded,
and the range of integration can be made arbitrarily small. Thus, as $b_m \to
1$, the solution $a_n$ of equation~\ref{eqn:existence-18} must approach $0$.

\end{proof}

\begin{remark}

The value of each $a_i$ depends only on those parameters $b_j$ that are larger
than $a_i$. The remaining parameters can be changed, and new parameters may be
added. Also, the process is symmetric: if $a_1, \dots, a_n, \beta$ are given
parameters, equations~\ref{eqn:existence-15}, \ref{eqn:existence-17},
\ref{eqn:existence-19}, and~\ref{eqn:existence-21} have unique solutions $b_1,
\dots, b_m$. Results like those of Lemma~\ref{lemma:unique-inc-dec} will hold.

\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}

The system of equations~\ref{eqn:existence-14}--\ref{eqn:existence-23} has a
unique solution. This solution determines two strategies $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ that
are optimal, and these are the only optimal strategies that belong to the class
$O$.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

It is sufficient to show that the system has a unique solution $a_1, \dots,
a_n$, $b_1, \dots, b_m$, $h_1, \dots, h_n$, $k_1, \dots, k_m$, $\alpha$,
$\beta$. Then $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ can be defined by
equations~\ref{eqn:characterization-8} and~\ref{eqn:characterization-9}. The
normalizing equations show that $F$ and $G$ are strategies, and the remaining
equations show that $F$ and $G$ satisfy the hypotheses of
Lemma~\ref{lemma:optimality-of-corresponding-strategies}. The remark that
follows that lemma shows that no other strategies in the class $O$ can be
optimal.

\textbf{Existence}. Consider two numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that

\[
0 \leq \alpha < 1, \qquad \alpha \beta = 0, \qquad 0 \leq \beta < 1,
\]

and construct a set of numbers $a_1^*, \dots, a_n^*, b_1^*, \dots, b_n^*$ as
follows: first, compute two numbers $a_n$ and $b_m$ by means of
equations~\ref{eqn:existence-18} and~\ref{eqn:existence-19} using no parameters
in the definitions of $f^*$ and $g^*$; the resulting numbers are compared and
the larger one is kept as a parameter; for definiteness, we assume that $a_n >
b_m$, and define $a_n^* = a_n$; the smaller number is neglected. In the next
step a number $a_{n-1}$ is computed by means of equation~\ref{eqn:existence-20}
(without parameters), and a new $b_m$ is computed from
equation~\ref{eqn:existence-19}, using the single parameter $a_n^*$. It is
clear that the new $b_m$ is smaller than the one computed in the previous step,
and therefore $b_m < a_n^*$; the two numbers $a_{n-1}$ and $b_m$ are compared,
and the larger one is kept as a parameter. For definiteness, one may assume
that $a_{n-1} > b_m$, and define $a_{n-1}^* = a_{n-1}$. The process is
continued in this manner: at each step, a new $a_i$ and a new $b_j$ are
computed, using as parameters the previously starred $a$'s and $b$'s; the two
numbers are compared, and the larger one is kept as a parameter, denoted by
$a_i^*$ (or $b_j^*$); the corresponding $h_i^*$ (or $k_j^*$) is computed by
means of the appropriate normalizing equation. Since each parameter is smaller
than those computed previously, it is clear that the resulting set is
self-consistent: that is, if $b_1^*, \dots, b_m^*$ are used as parameters, one
obtains again $a_1^*, \dots, a_n^*$, and conversely. Therefore, these numbers
satisfy the system of equations, \emph{except for
equation}~\ref{eqn:existence-22}.

Now, consider $a_1^*$ and $b_1^*$ as functions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. If the
previous construction is carried out with $\alpha = \beta = 0$, it may happen
that $a_1^* = b_1^*$, and all equations are satisfied; otherwise, either $a_1^*
< b_1^*$ or $b_1^* < a_1^*$; for definiteness \emph{it may be assumed that}
$b_1^* < a_1^*$. In this case, the same construction is applied with $\alpha=0,
\beta=1-\varepsilon$, and $\varepsilon$ is chosen so small that in the first
step $a_n < b_m$, and $b_m^* = b_m$ is arbitrarily close to 1. In the remaining
steps $a_n$ is always computed with the parameter $b_m$, and $a_n \to 0$; thus
all the $b^*$'s are computed without parameters and remain bounded away from
zero; then $a_1^* < a_n^* < b_1^*$; the inequality has been reversed as $\beta$
increased from $0$ to $1$. Since the $a$'s and $b$'s are limits of integration
of strictly positive densities, it is clear that $a_1^*$ and $b_1^*$ are
continuous functions of $\beta$, and there exists a positive $\beta$ for which
$a_1^* = b_1^*$. If the construction with $\alpha = \beta = 0$ leads to the
inequality $a_1^* < b_1^*$, the system of equations has a solution with $\alpha
> 0, \beta = 0$.

\textbf{Uniqueness}. The solution is unique. Indeed, suppose that $a_1, \dots,
a_n$, $b_1, \dots, b_m$ and $a_1^*, \dots, a_n^*$, $b_1^*, \dots, b_m^*$ are
two solutions. These solutions give rise to two pairs of optimal strategies
$F(x), G(y)$ and $F^*(x), G^*(y)$. Since $G$ and $G^*$ are optimal

\[
\int \Psi(x, y) dF(x) = v, \qquad \textup{ for all } y \in S_{G^*}, y_m \neq 1.
\]

The corollary to Lemma~\ref{lemma:value-of-the-game} shows that $S_{G^*}
\subset S_G$. Since the argument is symmetric, the two measures must have the
same supports, i.e., $b_j^* = b_j$, for all $j$. Similarly, $a_i^* = a_i$.
